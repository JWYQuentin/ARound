Fueled by such hypnotic tracks as “Hungersite” (which spent multiple weeks among the top 10 at Triple A radio outlets nationwide), the album proved a phenomenon, debuting at #2 on Billboard’s “Top New Artist Albums” chart amidst critical applause from such national outlets as Rolling Stone, which hailed it as “both sweet headphone ear candy and the foundation for a perfect live peak.”

Formed in 2007, in a town renowned for its crime and poverty their sound blends everything from crushing nu-metal riffs and twisted alt-rock, to experimental hip-hop, electronica and dark jazz, standing proudly apart from the common modern metal herd.
King 810 punctured the mainstream consciousness in 2012, when their “Midwest Monsters” EP earned them a deal with Roadrunner Records. “Memoirs Of A Murderer” the band’s full-length debut emerged to great acclaim later that year.
Breaking new ground in 2015 with mixtape “Midwest Monsters 2”:
The following year, King 810 released the audacious “La Petite Mort Or A Conversation With God”. The extraordinary, visceral poetry and prose of frontman David Gunn transmuted into the acoustic respite of the “Queen” EP before King 810 cut their big label ties embracing independence with 2018’s gleaming, esoteric “Suicide King” album.

Members Marc Roberge, Chris Culos, Richard On, Benj Gershman and Jerry DePizzo, along with touring members MikelParis and Jon Lampley,  are a band of brothers— 'The Goonies' of rock and roll. What began as a group of childhood friends making songs in the basement after school, O.A.R. would soon be living out their dreams, quietly selling out Madison Square Garden twice, filling Red Rocks Amphitheater over a dozen times, lighting up the Times Square New Year’s Eve celebration, selling millions of albums and building one of the most committed fanbases in the world. They recently released their tenth studio album ‘The Arcade’, along with their 13th consecutive Top 40 radio hit, and are joining forces with the Goo Goo Dolls for an extensive 2023 summer tour.

Formed in 2007, in a town renowned for its crime and poverty their sound blends everything from crushing nu-metal riffs and twisted alt-rock, to experimental hip-hop, electronica and dark jazz, standing proudly apart from the common modern metal herd.
King 810 punctured the mainstream consciousness in 2012, when their “Midwest Monsters” EP earned them a deal with Roadrunner Records. “Memoirs Of A Murderer” the band’s full-length debut emerged to great acclaim later that year.
Breaking new ground in 2015 with mixtape “Midwest Monsters 2”:
The following year, King 810 released the audacious “La Petite Mort Or A Conversation With God”. The extraordinary, visceral poetry and prose of frontman David Gunn transmuted into the acoustic respite of the “Queen” EP before King 810 cut their big label ties embracing independence with 2018’s gleaming, esoteric “Suicide King” album.

Quinn has shared the stage with his hero and mentor Buddy Guy, as well as Carlos Santana on several occasions. Quinn’s performance experience includes appearances on leading national television programs such as The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, Conan, and The Oprah Winfrey Show, to name a few.

""I want to stay true to where I come from, and go from there,"" says Sullivan. “The artists that inspire me to do that are always hungry for the new. They never repeat themselves. They just grow and become more unique -- and that's what I aim to do as an artist.”

Formed in 2007, in a town renowned for its crime and poverty their sound blends everything from crushing nu-metal riffs and twisted alt-rock, to experimental hip-hop, electronica and dark jazz, standing proudly apart from the common modern metal herd.
King 810 punctured the mainstream consciousness in 2012, when their “Midwest Monsters” EP earned them a deal with Roadrunner Records. “Memoirs Of A Murderer” the band’s full-length debut emerged to great acclaim later that year.
Breaking new ground in 2015 with mixtape “Midwest Monsters 2”:
The following year, King 810 released the audacious “La Petite Mort Or A Conversation With God”. The extraordinary, visceral poetry and prose of frontman David Gunn transmuted into the acoustic respite of the “Queen” EP before King 810 cut their big label ties embracing independence with 2018’s gleaming, esoteric “Suicide King” album.

In November of 2023, they released a new album titled Sonic Mojo which debuted at #1 on the Billboard Blues Charts and as of this writing has stayed in the Top Ten for 27 Weeks! They are still out on the road, traveling across the land and bringing their infectious boogie to packed houses full of adoring fans nearly every night. A Foghat concert is every bit as much fun and intense in 2024 as it was in 1977 when their classic multi-platinum album, Foghat Live broke them around the world. Looking back, it is only fitting that it was a live album that made Foghat a household name.  Today, Foghat consists of Roger Earl pounding the skins, long time member Bryan Bassett (Molly Hatchet, Wild Cherry) on lead/slide guitar, singer/bassist Rodney O’Quinn (Pat Travers Band) on bass & vocals, and newest member, lead vocalist and guitarist Scott Holt (Buddy Guy).

Formed in 2007, in a town renowned for its crime and poverty their sound blends everything from crushing nu-metal riffs and twisted alt-rock, to experimental hip-hop, electronica and dark jazz, standing proudly apart from the common modern metal herd.
King 810 punctured the mainstream consciousness in 2012, when their “Midwest Monsters” EP earned them a deal with Roadrunner Records. “Memoirs Of A Murderer” the band’s full-length debut emerged to great acclaim later that year.
Breaking new ground in 2015 with mixtape “Midwest Monsters 2”:
The following year, King 810 released the audacious “La Petite Mort Or A Conversation With God”. The extraordinary, visceral poetry and prose of frontman David Gunn transmuted into the acoustic respite of the “Queen” EP before King 810 cut their big label ties embracing independence with 2018’s gleaming, esoteric “Suicide King” album.

Since 1991, the group has enthralled listeners with a singular sound that fearlessly crisscrosses genres. The trio’s questing spirit drives it to explore the intersections between rock, jazz, classical, and world music. It even throws in the occasional surf or spaghetti Western tune for good measure.

Comprised of Bert Lams, Tom Griesgraber and Paul Richards, the group has established a unique, personal connection with audiences. In addition to dazzling musicianship and interplay, The California Guitar Trio’s (CGT) shows are full of captivating stories and humor that enable concertgoers to feel like they’re part of the music, not just spectators.

Formed in 2007, in a town renowned for its crime and poverty their sound blends everything from crushing nu-metal riffs and twisted alt-rock, to experimental hip-hop, electronica and dark jazz, standing proudly apart from the common modern metal herd.
King 810 punctured the mainstream consciousness in 2012, when their “Midwest Monsters” EP earned them a deal with Roadrunner Records. “Memoirs Of A Murderer” the band’s full-length debut emerged to great acclaim later that year.
Breaking new ground in 2015 with mixtape “Midwest Monsters 2”:
The following year, King 810 released the audacious “La Petite Mort Or A Conversation With God”. The extraordinary, visceral poetry and prose of frontman David Gunn transmuted into the acoustic respite of the “Queen” EP before King 810 cut their big label ties embracing independence with 2018’s gleaming, esoteric “Suicide King” album.
